"""The conductor — SKOPOS's orchestration of one remediation job.

It runs the state machine for a single MOMUS ticket: drive the Factory to patch, ask MOMUS to
re-test the patch (the gate), sign a DeployOrder embedding MOMUS's fixed-verdict, dispatch it to
the node agent on the target host, then ask MOMUS to re-test once more IN PLACE to confirm the live
container is clean. Bounded retries; anything touching the security core, or a job that can't be
fixed, escalates to a human.

The conductor signs DeployOrders with its OWN key and never redeploys anything itself — the
installed node agent does, and only after verifying the full chain. SKOPOS conducts; it does not
wield deploy authority directly.
