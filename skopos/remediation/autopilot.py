"""The finger on the trigger — scheduled scans, and the rule that dispatches without a human.

Everything downstream of a remediation ticket has been live and proven for a while, and none of
it ever ran, because nothing started it: there was no scan schedule anywhere, and POST /remediate
is operator-gated with exactly one caller. The loop was a machine with nobody's hand on it.

This is that hand, and it is deliberately the smallest one that could work.

**Why it lives here and not in MOMUS.** MOMUS is the auditor; giving it the initiative to act on
its own findings is the same conflict the patch denylist already refuses one layer down. So the
component that decides *what to conduct* is the conductor's, and the auditor keeps answering only
when asked.

**Why it does not wait for status == "confirmed".** It cannot: nothing in production ever sets
that status. `Status.CONFIRMED` appears in the momus tree only in tests, so every finding stays
"raw" forever and a dispatcher gated on it would never fire once. The evidence that a finding is
real and not a flake is already in the corpus under a different name — `seen_count`, bumped per
dedup key on every scan that rediscovers the same bug — plus an independent verifier's verdict
when one exists. A bug that reproduced across N separate scans is the honest local meaning of
"confirmed", and it is stated here rather than smuggled into a status field that means something
else.

Measured on the live deployment: GET /findings does NOT return the verdicts table, so the verdict
short-circuit below is currently unreachable and the sighting count is the whole gate. The code
for it stays because it is correct the day that route carries verdicts — but nobody should read
this and believe an independent verifier is in the loop today.

**Fail closed, everywhere.** Off unless explicitly enabled. A component absent from the policy is
never dispatched — and the components that must never be touched are refused by a denylist rather
than by being absent, for the same reason the Factory's patch scope has one: omission is a
default, and a default is what someone widening a config overrides without noticing.
