                                          (bounded retries loop back to FIXING)
    ESCALATED  (security-core findings, retries exhausted, or a rollback → human)

PUSHING and BUILDING are the steps whose absence made this loop unable to heal anything: without a
commit there was no reviewable artifact, and without a build there was no patched image, so
"deploying" recreated the container from the image already on the host and the gate had nothing new
to judge.

Persisted as JSONL so the SKOPOS dashboard can render a live board and a restart loses nothing.
