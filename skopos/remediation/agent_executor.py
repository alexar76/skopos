"""The deploy executor that runs ON a SKOPOS node agent — the constrained deployer.

This is the *only* code path by which a redeploy happens, and it is deliberately small and
paranoid. Before it does anything it runs ``verify_deploy_chain`` (MOMUS-fixed verdict +
conductor signature + local service allowlist). Only then does it run a single, fixed-shape
redeploy command for that one allowlisted service. It never accepts an arbitrary command; the
DeployOrder carries a service name, not a shell string, so there is nothing to inject.

Default is DRY-RUN: it validates and reports the command it *would* run, executing nothing. A real
node agent flips ``dry_run=False`` and provides the compose file for its host.

**A deploy that cannot be undone is a one-way door.** So this executor does three things beyond
running the command, and they are what make turning ``dry_run`` off defensible:

1. **It writes down where it came from.** Before recreating anything it reads the running
   container's image digest and the image reference compose names for it, and journals both
   (``agent_state.py``). That record is the only rollback target that exists; nothing in the order
   supplies one.
2. **It gates its own work.** ``docker compose up`` exits 0 the moment the container is created —
   long before a container that crash-loops on the new image has had time to fail. So the executor
   waits, then checks the container is actually up, not restarting, and not unhealthy.
3. **It undoes its own damage, immediately.** A failed health gate rolls back on the spot rather
   than reporting a broken service and waiting for instructions. Waiting would mean a poll interval
   of downtime for a fault the agent has already diagnosed locally.

The conductor can also order a rollback for the case only MOMUS can see — the patch deployed and
came up healthy, but the finding still reproduces against the live container. That path is
``execute_rollback``, and it resolves its target from this agent's journal, never from the order.
