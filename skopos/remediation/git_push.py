"""Committing a machine-authored patch to a branch — the conductor's git hand.

The Factory produces a *diff*. That diff has to become a commit before anything can build it, and it
has to land somewhere a human can read, review and revert. This module does that, and only that.

Three properties are deliberate, and each one is a refusal rather than a preference:

**Branch only, never main, never force.** The worst thing a stolen credential can do here is create a
branch nobody merges. ``main`` protection on the server is a second, independent policy — one of
them being misconfigured must not be enough.

**Two commits, in this order, because the chain cannot be complete at push time.** The build needs a
commit to build; the gate verdict only exists after the build; the agent's result only after the
deploy. So the patch is pushed first, and the provenance sidecar is pushed afterwards as a second
commit. Writing a sidecar up front would mean fabricating an ``agent_result`` that had not happened —
and a provenance record that invents a field is worse than one that omits it.

**The sidecar satisfies the MERGE-SIDE validator, not the design doc.** ``scripts/pull_momus_fixes.sh``
is executable code that gates the merge, so it wins where the two disagree: it wants ``finding_id``,
``component``, ``gate_verdict``, ``conductor_pubkey`` and ``history`` at the TOP level, insists on
``gate_verdict.fixed is True`` with a named verifier key, and **rejects any record containing a bare
IPv4**. That last rule is load-bearing rather than cosmetic — this repo has a standing incident about
private hosts leaking into committed files — so every string that reaches the record is scrubbed.
