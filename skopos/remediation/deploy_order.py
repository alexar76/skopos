"""The signed DeployOrder — the authorization a node agent needs before it will redeploy anything.

The order chains two signatures so no single party can make a deploy happen on its own:

  1. MOMUS signs a ``fixed`` retest verdict (finding no longer reproduces on the patched build).
  2. SKOPOS's conductor signs a DeployOrder that EMBEDS that verdict and names the exact service +
     host + image to ship.

A node agent runs ``verify_deploy_chain`` before touching anything: it checks the conductor's
signature under the SKOPOS pubkey it learned at enrollment, checks the embedded verdict's signature
under MOMUS's known pubkey, checks the verdict is actually ``fixed`` and bound to this finding, and
checks the service is on its OWN local allowlist. Any failure → refuse. This is the whole reason a
compromised conductor still cannot ship arbitrary code to a host: it cannot forge MOMUS's verdict,
and the agent will not deploy a service it was not pre-authorized to touch.

**Going back.** A forward deploy is gated on a MOMUS ``fixed`` verdict; a rollback cannot be, because
you roll back exactly when that verdict turned out to be wrong. Demanding one would make the undo
path unusable in the only situation it exists for. So :class:`RollbackOrder` drops the verdict and
replaces it with a different, stronger constraint: **it carries no image**. It names a prior order,
and the agent resolves the target from its OWN journal of what it saw running before that deploy
(see ``agent_state.py``). A compromised conductor can therefore ask a host to return to a state that
host provably occupied — and cannot use the undo path to ship anything new.

``kind`` is inside the signed body of both orders, and each verifier rejects the other's kind, so a
deploy order can never be replayed as a rollback (or the reverse) by relabelling it on the wire.
