"""Strip secrets out of log-derived values without costing any analytics.

SKOPOS ingests other people's access logs, which means it ingests whatever those
sites put in a URL: session tokens, password-reset links, magic-link codes,
tracking identifiers. None of that is anything SKOPOS needs, and all of it ends
up on disk, on the dashboard, and — before this module existed — in prompts sent
to a third-party LLM.

The obvious fix, dropping query strings, is not available: the dashboard groups
by path, bot detection reads path shape, and per-parameter breakdowns are
something operators actually use. So this redacts by **the shape of the value**
rather than by throwing the whole thing away:

    /api?mode=live&limit=80        unchanged — nothing here identifies anyone
    /reset?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1  ->  /reset?token=<redacted>
    /t?visitor_id=a3f9c2e1b7d4     ->  /t?visitor_id=<redacted>

Two independent rules decide, and either one is enough to redact:

* the parameter is **named** like a credential (``token``, ``password``, ``sig``);
* the value **looks** like one — long, and drawn from the alphabet of a hex
  digest, a base64 blob or a JWT, with no spaces or words in it.

The second rule is what makes this hold up against a parameter nobody thought to
put on a list. The first is what catches a short secret. Together they leave
``mode=live``, ``page=3``, ``lang=ru`` and ``west=1953`` exactly as they were,
which is the whole point: a privacy control that breaks the dashboard gets turned
off, and then it protects nobody.
