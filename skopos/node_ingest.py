"""Authenticate a pushed report and turn it into rows.

The order of operations here is the security design, so it is worth stating
plainly:

1. Read headers. Verify the HMAC over the **raw body bytes** before the body is
   parsed, so an unauthenticated peer never reaches the JSON parser.
2. Resolve ``key_id`` to a server through the credential table. The report's own
   content has no say in which server it belongs to.
3. Claim the sequence number in one conditional UPDATE. A replayed or reordered
   report loses the race and is dropped.
4. Only then validate the document and ingest it, through the same enrich and
   dedup path SSH-collected lines take.

Two kinds of document arrive on that path. Log lines from a monitored host are
the original and carry no ``kind``; a board pushed by the remediation conductor
declares ``kind: remediation`` and is routed to its own store instead.

Every authentication failure returns the same thing. Distinguishing "unknown
key" from "bad signature" from "revoked" would let anyone with a socket
enumerate the fleet.
